What is you site's primary purpose?

My site's primary purpose is to host various blogs and projects throughout my time at EDA.

Who is your target audience?

My target audience is fellow students, tutors and other EDA staff, potential employers and something for my portfolio.

How do you want site visitors to interact with your site? What experience would you like them to have?

I would like them to fully understand how the site works, it needs to be simple to operate and easy to understand. The layout should be mobile and desktop friendly. Their experience should be bug free. Layout and content should be easy to read and not hard on the eyes. Clean, crisp and clear. 

How will you build your site to support your desired user experience?

I will use responsive web design and incorporate a hamburger menu for mobile users. I will find easy to read fonts and use colors that constrast well and don't cause eye strain.
